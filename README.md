## Overview
This project is designed to enable real-time synchronization between Google Sheets and a MySQL database. It uses Django as the web framework and integrates with Google Sheets API to automate the synchronization process. The system ensures that any changes made in Google Sheets are reflected in the database and vice versa.

##Technologies Used
-Django: Web framework for building the web application.
-MySQL: Database used for storing and managing data.
-Google Sheets API: Used to interact with Google Sheets for data synchronization.
-Webhooks: To handle real-time updates between the database and Google Sheets.
-Bootstrap: For styling the web pages.

## Features
1.Real-Time Synchronization: Detects changes in Google Sheets and updates the MySQL database accordingly. Similarly, changes in the database are reflected in Google Sheets.
2.CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both Google Sheets and the database.
3.Dynamic Table Creation: Creates a new database table based on the structure of the Google Sheet if it does not exist.
4.Triggers and Webhooks: Uses MySQL triggers and webhooks to handle real-time synchronization.
